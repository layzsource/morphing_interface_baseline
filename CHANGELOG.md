# Changelog

## [1.6.2] - 2025-09-28
### Fixed
- Corrected Torus morph target to use full 360Â° arc (`Math.atan2` for complete range).
### Benefits
- Torus now renders as a complete ring rather than a sliced bagel.
- Smooth interpolation with other morph targets preserved.

## [1.6.1] - 2025-09-28
### Fixed
- Scaled shadow plane relative to vessel size (2Ã— state.scale).
- Reduced base opacity to 0.1, audio-reactivity modulates up to ~0.3.
- Repositioned shadow plane farther back (z = -20).
- Forced shadow color to black for proper projection (no green overlays).
### Benefits
- Shadows now appear as subtle background projections.
- Visual regression (large green block) fully resolved.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-09-28
### Added
- Shadows module (src/shadows.js) as first consumer of state.js.
- Shadows scale + color linked to Vessel state.
- Shadows opacity modulated by audio bands when audio enabled.
### Benefits
- Demonstrates state.js modular expansion.
- Adds second visual layer to engine (Vessel + Shadows).
- Validates extensibility for future Sprites/Particles.

## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-28
### Added
- New `src/state.js` for centralized modular state management.
- Signal routing modules: `midiRouter.js`, `hudRouter.js`, `audioRouter.js`, `presetRouter.js`.
- True modular signal-to-form pipeline architecture.
### Changed
- MIDI, HUD, and Audio modules now update centralized state instead of geometry directly.
- Geometry module reads from state each frame (rotation, scale, morph weights, color, lighting).
- Telemetry updated to reflect values directly from centralized state.
- Preset system redesigned to save/load complete application state.
### Benefits
- Decoupled architecture prevents regressions when adding new features.
